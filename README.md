Arithmatic Calculator using Stack and Queue for COMP 352 assignment


In  this  programming  assignment,  you  will first  design using  pseudo  code two  versions  of arithmetic calculators.
The first  version will  be  based  on  the  pseudo  code  discussed  in  class  that uses two different stacks. The 
second version must be completely based on recursion and must not use any stack (however, we know by now that recursion will 
implicitly use JVM’s own stack as in regular function  calls). 
You  will  implement  the first  version in  Java. Your arithmetic  calculators 
must  read  lines  of  text  from  a  text  file,  where  each  line  contains  a  syntactically  correct  arithmetic 
expression. Your output file must repeat the input line and print the computed result on the next line. 
Your calculators must support the following operators on integers and observe the standard operator precedence  as  shown 
in  the  following (1  to  8:1  is  highest  and  8  is  lowest.  Same  precedence operators are evaluated from left to right). 
1.Parentheses (possibly nested ones)
2. factorial: !
3. minus: - 
4. power function: x^y. 
5. operators: *, / 
6. operators: +, 
7. operators: >, ≥, ≤, < 
8. operators: ==, !
